Few days back , I wrote an article about creating a php code to create a database and store and print data at user's request.




Wouldn't it be easier if there was a better way to manage this nasty stuff.I mean , in every project there is a need to create and store data .If it is so general in use , shouldn't there be a better way of handling it?Shouldn't we focus more on the application login than to waste time in connecting /creating databases?




This is just one instance , there are plenty of other instances where you will find yourself in a situation of writing code for very typical functions.




Just to handle those typical functions , Web framework comes in handy.It's easy to manage the database and no time is spent in debugging connections problems , and also it makes the code much more organized and productive.




More on this and a quick starting up tutorial on using a PHP framework in the next article.Stay tuned ;)Â

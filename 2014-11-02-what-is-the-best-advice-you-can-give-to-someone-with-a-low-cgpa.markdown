Answer by Harish Sivaramakrishnan:



<blockquote>This is a personal anecdote of someone that had a low cgpa. Me.  
  
1. I joined engineering at BITS, Pilani because I just did not know what I wanted or what I was good at when I was 18. I was offered chemical engineering.  
  
2. I had low aptitude on physics and allied physics courses and was still figuring out if engineering was indeed what I wanted to do. Flunked mechopt, thermodynamics and phy chem in first sem, made a decent grade in CP1.  
  
3. Started learning html, spent a lot of time making and deleting forms in IPC , Mostly during insti hours. Spent the remaining time at Music club and sky - loved to play music, dint quite know what it meant to me, though. Flunked several courses again, surprisingly, A in cp2.  
  
3. Enter CDC sem, Dr. Rahul Banerjee took me under his fold for a web project for DLPD and CSD. More fun working with stuff like flash, javascript etc. Real projects, better computers and some social propriety. CGPA low.  
  
4. Unadulterated hate for chemical CDCs. I had no interest in the subjects, many of them made no sense to me at all. 2 Es in a row. On the other side, got faster and better in web technologies. Reputation of a good design hacker, course slacker  
  
5. Started writing original music. Spent late hours listening and playing music, waking up at lunch time almost everyday. Make ups, make make ups. CDCs not making any sense even now. 2 Es in a row again.  
  
6. Final sem - thanks to 9/11 placements in an all time low. With a CGPA like mine, no company would let me write the apti. More hours in CSD, serious code hacking in flash actionscript, more music.  
  
7. Graduated at the bottom 10% of the class. With the following - web programming, design, better singing skills but low self esteem and confidence  
  
I was also told that 4 years of engineering was wasted by me by several people.  
  
Cut to present -  
  
12 years since - I ended up becoming an engineer and later a worldwide web and open standards evangelist at Adobe systems and now figuring out the design and front end engg for [freecharge.in](http://freecharge.in) ( afterall, all those skipped classes for writing code wasnt all that worthless )  
  
My band Agam became the first ever MTV Push artist at the MTV video and music awards India. Prior to that we became the only independent artist to be featured as a solo producer at Coke Studio at MTV Season 2  
  
No , this is not about how awesome I am - I am actually an average, pretty ordinary guy driven by extreme amounts of passion. Thats all I had and thats what drives me even today.  
  
So, if you are passionate and have faith in what you are doing, your CGPA would be the least of your concerns.</blockquote>

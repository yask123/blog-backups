Okkey! , after one year of blogging in wordpress , I decided to move here.




Things on word press were getting too personal , I had to change it's visibility option to personal.Yeah! ,I wrote about EVERYTHING in that blog.




But , enough of that , I'll try to maintain this one better , and will try my best not to put in the situation where I am obligated to make this blog private too .




Well , Day after tomorrow is my Maths exams! , Tons of things are coming.




I have done most of them , I am getting the feeling of double/triple integrals and their applications. The idea to calculate the volume by taking a minute cube of dV=dX dY dZ , is quite  nifty. This chapter has got some application problems as well , I am enjoying learning it.




But , I still haven't got the hang of complex variables. It's too much for me to do and understand everything. I'll probably be skipping some stuff .

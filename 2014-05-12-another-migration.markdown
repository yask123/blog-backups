I started Web Development by reading O'relly's book.The book was super motivating.Ever since then I have followed thereof instructions for running Php  based website on Apache web server.

I have recently been involved with lots of Python Coding.I must admit  , this is getting weird.It's becoming my favourite programming language.The more I code in it , the more I love it.There is just so much to learn , and Python is Damn easy!

Any one with endless coding sessions can get bored.That's why , I often get myself involved in small projects related to what I am learning.Yea!I am thinking to take my Python web app to the cloud.

Welcome Google app engine.Today was the first day(not technically , it's 2:36  AM now) .Installing this piece of beauty on Linux was damn easy!I almost got started after downloading a small 50mb file.

Good bye Apache! , I'm moving to GAE.

Another cool advantage of GAE is that you can upload your small projects on their web server for FREE!This couldn't get any better!Where have you been all this time in my life?

I think I love Google too much.

Yesterday on my birthday at around 8 pm I finally purchased the domain name `www.Anonymouschatters.com`.

I was watching a video on Youtube tittled `You are overdoing your UI/UX`. His speach inspired me to go ahead with whatever I had.

The core-chat app will get a significant update after I change it from `Ajax` and implement it with `channel api`.

It’s a small yet significantly usefull application. Anonymous chatts with awesome people can reveal significant insights. The candid , bold opinions are priceless!

I take UI/UX very seriously. Elegant and minimalistic design with short typical description ` A product is a

_________ that allows ____ to ______.` on landing page.

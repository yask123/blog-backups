From reading writing from text file , storing database in pickle(Python) ,using SQLlite for large DBMS and finally using GAE datastore .This is the journey of writing my very own Search Engine.

The concept is very simple.Start with a 'Seed Page' , look for links recursively ,create a hash-table for storing links with name as addresses and finally store this data for quick search next time(Indexing).Then there are ways you can improve efficiency of indexing , rankings by using different algorithms.I have just finished testing the app on my computer.Soon I will be uploading the code and deploy the app on the web.

This tool although looks very simple is quite useful.I am thinking of putting this search engine in my blog indexing post links.Another item in my to-do list.



Signing off.

Linked list is OLD

I can't think of it's implementation these days. It should be a crime to be even discussing about it today when  we can use awesome objects such as a list [as in Python]. But somewhere across a reddit post some one mentioned linked list reversal thing and I thought to myself to implement this in python because I have nothing to do.
 <!--more--> 

I haven't done much object-oriented related stuff in python much. Mostly working with script without ever making classes or even a function. So this was  just to revise pretty basic stuff.

Here is a simple implementation on linked list , function to reverse it and to find the middle element by Floyed's Algorithm.

I had heard quite a lot about nix operating system.I had Mac OS X Mountain Lion installed on my desktop (Technically Hackintosh) , but just as I updated it , it ran into kernel panic mode.Due to busy schedule , I didn't bother repairing it and installed windows.

It's been a while since I moved to Linux.It was a bit frustrating a bit in early stages , but now I seem to have made a full transition.

There were lots of problems for a general user.First , there are so many packaging for different distro.There isn't a uniformity.Developers have to employ significant amountÂ of time , just to get there software working on Linux(Different Distros).Secondly , there are quite a few Linux users(Desktop) , that means the market is low for major software developers.Google Drive is still not available to Linux(Although Dropbox is , thank GOD!) ,GUI GIT isn't available(Who cares?) , but the list doesn't stop there.There are many softwares you won't find on windows.Remember how easy it was to install uTorrent client on windows , It is sick on linux.It runs inside a freaking browser!

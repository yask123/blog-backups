This techno track has been stuck in my head for months. Julian Casablancas's voice really suits this techno music.




I also liked Julian casablancas 's song "Under Cover By Darkness".




Lyrics and music really touches the heart and the solo guitar creates vibes in the heart. The credit here goes to both the band "The strokes" and the awesome soft voice of Julian




Here is the youtube link of "Under Cover of darkness"

Spoiler : By dev tools I mean Text Editor ðŸ˜’

I have started using `vim` these days. Sublime text is distracting for me. The random popups to register and it doesn't run inside from a terminal.ðŸ˜¤
 <!--more--> 

On the other hand working on vim is much distraction free environment. It's full screen , you don't even touch mouse and the thought of checking Facebook notification goes because you are too lazy to move to mouse Â .ðŸ˜œ

I was using `Janus` first which cluttered my `.vimrc` file with ugly configurations I could barely understand. On mac I upgraded to latest vim `brew install vim` and straight away went to this awesome website. http://vimawesome.com

Installed the most important stuff required in code-editor `solarized color scheme`. And some more custom plugins I can't like without like `NERDTree` `CTRLP` `Gist` .. and stuff.

I have a basic .vimrc file most of the stuff related to color scheme and the last line for python file execution [remapping key f9]

Here is a list of bundles I installed , pasting it here for future reference:Â ðŸ˜‡

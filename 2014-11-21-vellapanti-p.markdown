Scrapped `http://watchtvseries.to/` to build another CLI app to immediately get you to your favorite episode streaming page.

And then I spent the rest of my time watching episodes online :P

Also I discovered this awesome app for chrome `Journal`. I used `Dayone` App on Mac OS X (2 years ago), and loved it. Finally there is a descent journal app for multiple platforms. Do try it !

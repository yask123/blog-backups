Assume there are 2 peoples , both want to share an information , secret code .




This system was discovered by 2 awesome people , let's look at the problem a bit closer.




Usually to send a secret message , we require 2 things.A lock and the key.It's simple.2 people who want to share the message needs to know these basic things.The other person need to know the key.




But assume that sending the key to the other person isn't quite possible.Now what?




Well , there is a clever way of solving this problem.Let's visualize the situation.




We can solve the problem if we use a function whose solution is very easy to find  , but very difficult to find out the input from the output result.




This will help us solve the problem




One such function (Non mathematical) is to mix 2 colors.It's difficult to interpret by whose combination the resultant mixture has been formed , but very easy to mix the color.

Lets take 3 people.Jerry wants to send the message to Dog , but doesn't want it's message to be revealed to Tom.For this situation(With context to the function we are using) let the secret message be a secret color.




First Jerry and tom agrees to a public color (GREEN)which is visible to everyone(even Tom).Then each individual (Dog and Jerry) picks up there own secret color and mix it with the public color chosen.Say ,jerry picks up color (Red) and Dog picks up color  (Blue).Now each one of them mixes the public color with there secret colors and send it to each other publically.(Tom can see all the color transfer being made).So jerry send Yellow color to Dog and Dog sends Cyan color to jerry.Now Dog can mix the Jerry's mixture color to his own color to make Jerry's secret color(Yello + Blue)=(Red) .Thus , Jerry's color is easily transferred to Dog.Although Tom sees the mixture colors being transferred , but he can't intepret the secret color as he doesn't know what secret color the individual chose in the first place.Only mixture (Complex part) was transferred and as it was difficult to find the solution of this result , Jerry's secret remained secret! 





Just googled , The dog's name was spike ;)

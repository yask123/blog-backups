Lastly I was working on an Anonymous chatters web app.I played with it for a while today. Rewrote the complete chat app inside it.

Earlier it was more like a discussion page rather than a chat page. Enteries were written/read to/from the database only at the time of submission.

Now I wrote an ajax chat box , updating the part of the chatterbox every 5s.
 <!--more--> 
[code language="javascript"]

function setup() {
window.setInterval("updateChat()", 5000);
updateChat();
}

function updateChat() {
downloadUrl("/getchats/?groupname={{ groupname|safe }}", "GET", null, onChatsReturned);
}

[/code]

This is how it looks :D

Much better eh?

Javascript is really a fun language. Lots of hacks. Everytime while fixing bugs I learn something new. Which brings me to another topic , FOSS.

Currently I am mostly contributing to moin-moin as I talked before. Fixing bugs here and getting Javascript code reviewed by mentors has certainly improved me.

Yea!Before CRing I make sure code is void of any Jslint errors and yea the annoying trailing spaces â€¦ er..!

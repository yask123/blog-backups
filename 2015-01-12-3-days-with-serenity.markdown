How did that happen?

Sometimes I guess to teach me patience 'He' disconnects my internet for few days.

On 9th my exams came to an end and so did my internet connection. Stupid MTNL. They don't easily attend complaints. Not for 3 days at least.

I didn't have any interesting book nor any pdf stories so I decided to pass time watching telly.

Got bored easily.Although I did listen to the songs for hours as VH1 played in their `top 100 songs of the decade` playlist .

Heard some really old songs. Reminded me of schooldays, the songs we used to practice in school's talent contest , school buddies , the songs we used to listen in school cab on FM 95.0 , chords I learnt when I first bought my guitar and my first crush . Old songs always brings nostalgia.

My brother had few movies , I watched :



Then the wildest thought crossed my mind. Why don't I go outside?

At around 4pm the weather was awesome with light breeze and pinkinsh sky . I decided to stroll in Lodi Garden.

Since it was Sunday the place was crowded. Athletes jogging , families enjoying picnics , tourists ,photographers and the light water drops falling from the fountains on your skin :) .

This park is really inspiring . Most of the people were jogging. Kids , adults , cute girls  and even old people.

I was obliged to start jogging. I jogged but got tired in a few minutes.







The place is awesome ! Situated in institutional area surrounded by greenery somewhat isolated from outside street noise.





I strolled listenting to the music of birds , went inside an old fort , played soudtrack of Game Of Thrones inside my head and pretended to be a King .














Then I sat next to a pond watched swans and ducks hunting for fishes.




Swans are beautiful.




Ducks appears to be softly floating on pond but in fact they are swiftly moving there legs all the time.



















Fuck MTNL!




I should be writing about codes not nature!!  -_-

This is a follow up on my last script which was about scrapping correct Lyrics for your MP3 Collections from the web.

This app will download music of your choice :D !
 <!--more--> 

In this script I am using `BeatifulSoup`and `youtube-dl`to scrape song links from the search query and downloads music from the source link.

How cool is that ?

Just type the name of the song and maybe add the Album or Artist's name and Voila!!

Song Downloaded !

You can use my other script to download Lyrics for this downloaded song :P

Here is the Youtube Demo

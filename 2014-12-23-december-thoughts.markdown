It's so cold I can't feel my legs.

It was courageous of me to attend two events outside Delhi in between my end-term exams.
 <!--more--> 

The first was to IIT-KGP for onsite ACM-ICPC competition.It was on 6th-7th December and my computer graphics exam was on 8th December.I spent the entire time there worrying whether I would be able to reach college in time for the exams.

The train was 12 hours late for arrival in KGP. I knew I was screwed.But there was little I could do.Fortunately for arrival in Delhi it was 4 hours late and I made it to the exam right on time.

The second trip was to Lucknow , not too far from here and I arrived Delhi few days before my maths exam.

I recently updated to Yosemite and it is beautiful , I keep switching to safari browser just because it looks so damn pretty :P

I just finished setting up Yeoman on OS X machine and it is running fine. I had to struggle a lot to set this up on Ubuntu struggling with permission/dependency issues. The process was super smooth.I am using it to build the next version of BVPmart !

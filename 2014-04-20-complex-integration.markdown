Well , complex is the new world , different from the real world and imaginary numbers do exist here. We learnt to perform simple operations in complex numbers such as addition /multiplication division and even plotting it in Argand plane . We played with it's amplitude and used Nth unity of complex numbers to prove various expression and also found out sums of Sin angles in AP (it was N/2^(n-1)) [If I remember correctly ]




Now in college , it's time to form functions of complex numbers(w=u + iv) =f(z) and perform some advance operations like integration.




Well , usually in complex function , there is a need to integrate a function along a curve or a line , (or even a closed loop which is my favourite and can be easily solved by Cauchy's formula).




Lets take an example .Let f(z)=x^2+2yi . To integrate it , we write intg(f(z)dz)




Now , we only need to find out dz , since z=x+iy , dz=dx + idy.




After substituting , we write the function in the form by which it is integrate;e , ie , if dy is in multiplication with a term comsisting of both x and y , we express x in terms of y(from the expression given along which we have to integrate).




How to integrate closed integrals?




2 ways to do so(That I know) :-




1) This is easier approach , we use the result by Cauchy's formula that if the pole lies outside the circular region , the integral is zero( I can't derive it).




This makes the question much simpler , all those intergals whose poles are outside are ZERO .




There is another result from Cauchy's Integral ie Integ[ f(x)/(z-a)] = 2 pi i [f(a)].




Well , so for a given integral , we will first remove that pole which lies outside the circle (by dividing by the same factor in numerator and denominator )




Then we use the 2n result of C's formula to get the integral.

2)This method isn't quite easy , and is used for handling more complex integrals by finding residue..

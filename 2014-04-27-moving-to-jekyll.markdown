Very soon I will be moving to Jekyll 




Link:http://jekyllrb.com/




can't wait to type sudo apt-get install gem 




;)




The real reason is that jekyll doesn't require the need of any database , and the free web hosting website that I signed up for restricts the usage of mysql in free user mode.I can't pay yet.




Well , jekyll is an open source project written in Ruby , I am still going through the over all architecture of the project.Jekyll creates dynamic static pages. Although I have observed it will be difficult to integrate comment system in it , but i'll use something like disqus /




Disqus : It's a fancy word for discuss , lately it has become very popular in social websites.Comment system , I think it uses Django web framework , I am researching on that too.But I think i'll need to brush up my high level python scripting skills first.
